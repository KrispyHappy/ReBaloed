This is a small rebalance mod for Balarto, its aim is to make vouchers more interesting and comically weak jokers more than usable. Big thanks to Frich for teaching me how take_ownership works, Victin, Eremel, Galdur Wizard, GayCoonie for teaching me basics to Balatro modding and troubleshooting.

here's the as of now small list of changes are found here

have any suggestions? ideas? please do tell me! you can also make comments on the document

Disclaimer: this mod is work in progress, though the plans aren't big there is more to come, also by the nature of this mod it does make the game generally easier by making jokers better.
