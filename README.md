This is a small rebalance mod for Balarto, its aim is to make vouchers more interesting and comically weak jokers more than usable. Big thanks to Frich for teaching me how take_ownership works, Victin and Eremel, Galdur Wizard for teaching me some basics to Balatro modding and troubleshooting.

Disclaimer: this mod is work in progress, though the plans aren't big there is more to come, also by the nature of this mod it does make the game generally easier by making jokers better and more versatility from vouchers.
